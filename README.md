# Orc Fort
#### A board game.
It's that time of year again! The winds blow hot from the neighboring desert and the midsummer games are upon us. Chieftans from across the kingdom come to compete for blood and honor at the start of raiding season. Tents are pitched, colored banners flap in the wind and scent of fried meat and hot leather fill the valley. Onlookers arrive days early to see the competetors, speculate and wager about the biggest event of the year.

## How to Play
### Setup

### Turns
Each turn has several phases:
1. Build phase. Add a platform to your fort.
2. Collect resource phase. Roll the three 4 side dice and collect one resource for each die.
  ```
  1 = Wood
  2 = Iron
  3 = Blood
  4 = Magic
  ```
Collect resources from buildings you control.
Draw 1 action card.
3. Main phase. You can purchase new fort pieces, buildings and units using resources. You can also move units and attack other player's units and buildings. See combat for details on how to conduct combat.

### Units
During your turn, you may move each unit a number of squares up to the value in the unit's stats and take one action. Actions are listed in the stats of each unit, for example: melee attack, ranged attack, cast a spell.
Diagonal movement is not permitted.
Climbing up a level in the fort costs 3 movement.
Climbing down a level and moving horizontally costs 1 movement.
Actions and movement can be taken in any order. For example, you can move 2 squares, attack, and move another 4 squares (assuming your unit has a movement of 6).

### Combat
Attacks can only be made by the player who's turn it is. Each unit may have different types of attacks (melee, ranged, spell).
Units may attack other units, or buildings, but not the fort itself.
If, at the end of a turn, a unit has 0 or less hit points remaining, that unit is killed and removed from the battlefield. The player who killed it gains a point.
If a building has 0 or less hit points at the end of a turn, the attacking player may choose to destroy the building or take control of it.

### Rules
1. Each game has a set number of rounds. Standard game is 12 rounds, but you can decide to play a game of any length.
2. Action cards may be played during anyones turn, in the main phase.
3. Trading may take place during anyones turn.

## How to win
Orcs like to keep things simple. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
Points can be earned by killing opponents units or controlling buildings. Units are all worth 1 point each, but some buildings are more valuable than others.
