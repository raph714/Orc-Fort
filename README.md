# Orc Fort
#### A board game.
It's that time of year again! The winds blow hot from the neighboring desert and the midsummer games are upon us. Chieftans from across the kingdom come to compete for blood and honor at the start of raiding season. Tents are pitched, colored banners flap in the wind and scent of fried meat and hot leather fill the valley. Onlookers arrive days early to see the competetors, speculate and wager about the biggest event of the year.

## How to win
Orcs like to keep things simple. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. The game ends when either a player is knocked out of the game by having no more buildings or units on the board, or a player reaches the number of points agreed upon at the start of the game.

### Scoring Victory Points 
Points can be earned by killing opponents units or controlling buildings. Killing a unit is worth 1 point, each [building](BuildingsAndUnits.md) is worth one point.

## Setup
Each player chooses a starting base and one starting [unit](BuildingsAndUnits.md). The chosen unit is placed on the starting platform.
5 action cards are dealt to each player, and the player who rolls the highest on a 20 sided die goes first.

## Turn Order
Each turn has several phases:
1. Build phase. Add a platform to your fort. If there are no platforms left, skip this step.
2. Collect resource phase. 
    - Roll the three 4 side dice and collect one resource for each die OR take one resource of your choice.
      - 1 = Wood
      - 2 = Iron
      - 3 = Blood
      - 4 = Magic
    - Collect anything that is produced by [buildings](BuildingsAndUnits.md) in your control.
    - Draw 1 [action card](ActionCards.md).
3. Main phase. You can [purchase](Store.md) new fort pieces, [buildings](BuildingsAndUnits.md) and [units](Units.md) using resources. You can also move units and attack other player's units and buildings. You can purchase, move and attack in any order.

## Basic Rules
1. A standard game is either 12 rounds or the first player to 10 points, but you can decide to play a game of any length.
2. [Action cards](ActionCards.md) may be played during anyones turn, in the main phase.
3. Trading may take place during anyones turn.
4. There is no maximum hand size.

## [Units](BuildingsAndUnits.md)
During your turn, you may move each unit a number of squares up to the value in the unit's stats and take one action. Actions are listed in the stats of each unit, for example: melee attack, ranged attack, cast a spell.
Actions and movement can be taken in any order. For example, you can move 2 squares, attack, and move another 4 squares (assuming your unit has a movement of 6).  
Purchased units appear on your starting base. If there is no room on your starting base, they appear on the closest platform to it that is on the same height or lower. Units may move and attack on the turn they enter the board.

## Movement
You may move your units only on your turn.  
Diagonal movement is not permitted.  
Climbing up in the fort costs an extra movement per level. For example taking one forward movement that also causes a unit to go up one step requires 2 movement points.
Climbing down does not cost extra movement.
Units may only climb up one level at a time unless overridden by a special ability.

## Combat
Attacks can only be made by the player who's turn it is. Each unit may have different types of attacks (melee, ranged, spell).  
Units may attack other units, or buildings. Multiple attacks may be made on a single target as allowed by the rules of each attack.
Players have a chance to respond to each of the following phases:
Declare Attack - Player whos turn it is declares that one or more of their units are attacking.
Deal Damage - Player rolls damage for any attacking units.

#### Melee Attacks
For a melee attack, the unit must be standing next to the target, with no more than one level of height separating them. Units can swing up or down if one is on the ledge and one is below the ledge.

#### Ranged Attacks
To calculate a ranged attack, follow the same rules as movement. If a ranged attack is conducted across a gap in the fort, only calculate based the net difference in height between the two units. For example, if your unit is one level below the unit you want to attack, it will cost an extra 2 range to make the shot.

#### Roll For Damage
To conduct an attack, look at the stats for the unit you are attacking with and roll the die listed on the type of attack you are performing. For example, a barbarian making a melee attack would roll a 12 sided die and add 4 to the roll (d12 + 4) to determine the amount of damage done.  
If, at the end of a turn, a unit has 0 or less hit points remaining, that unit is killed and removed from the battlefield. The player who killed it gains a point.  
If a [building](BuildingsAndUnits.md) has 0 or less hit points at the end of a turn, the attacking player may choose to destroy the building or take control of it.  
Hit points for both units and buildings reset at the end of each turn.

## [Buildings](BuildingsAndUnits.md)
See linked resource for placement and cost for buildings. Friendly units may use the space a building occupies in movement, but may not stop moving on the same space as a building.
See combat for rules on how to take or destroy buildings.
